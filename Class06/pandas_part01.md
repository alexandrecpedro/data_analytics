# PANDAS - PART 01

## 1. PANDAS DEFINITION

- Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language

## 2. FOCUS

Built a specific project
A vehicle rental company (car hire firm) requires the development of a data stratification model. 
Specifically, a curated dataset will be made available to the user, allowing vehicles to be filtered according 
to their specific model, year of manufacture, and manufacturer

For this purpose, the Pandas library will be utilised to conduct a series of pre-analysis steps before 
generating the requested data stratum

To ensure effective project management and collaboration, the Trello platform will be employed for organisation 
and task tracking
