# üè• MEDICAL CLINIC

## üéØ 1. Project Overview and Objectives

This project focuses on developing a **data visualization dashboard** for a medical clinic. The primary goal is to provide end-users with actionable insights regarding **appointments, revenue, and specialty performance** within the clinic, ensuring data-driven decision-making.

### Core Objectives:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Establish a reliable process for reading and processing the clinic's appointment and revenue data.
2. **Analysis:** Calculate total revenue, revenue per unit, number of appointments per unit, and number of appointments per medical specialty.
3. **Specialty Insights:** Identify the medical specialty with the highest number of appointments per unit.
4. **Dashboard Development:** Build an interactive, visually appealing dashboard for easy exploration of the clinic's operational metrics.

## üìà 2. Scope and Business Value

### Enhanced Project Description:

The medical clinic requires a **data-driven dashboard** covering a specific date range (2025-10-06 to 2025-10-11) to support operational decision-making and performance monitoring. 

The dashboard will allow dynamic exploration of:

- Total revenue and revenue by unit
- Number of appointments per unit and per medical specialty
- Specialty with the highest patient volume per unit

This structured visualization will enable clinic managers to **quickly identify trends, assess unit performance, and allocate resources efficiently**.

## üíæ 3. Data Source

The project will utilise a **CSV file** containing comprehensive records of appointments and revenue.

| Data Source             | Description                                         | Key Attributes                                        | Access Link          |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------|
| **appointments.csv**    | Core appointment and revenue data for the clinic. | Appointment Date, Unit, Medical Specialty, Value     | `appointments.csv`  |

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Methodology and Tools

### Technical Approach:

The **Pandas library** in Python will be used to perform all data processing, including cleaning, aggregation, and computation of relevant metrics.  

**Streamlit** will be used to build the interactive dashboard, allowing dynamic exploration of revenue and appointment metrics.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 6. Execution Instructions

The project is implemented in Python and requires the Pandas and Streamlit libraries.

### Prerequisites

You must have Python installed. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas streamlit plotly
