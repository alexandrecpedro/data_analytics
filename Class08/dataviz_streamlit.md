# DATA VIZ - STREAMLIT

## 1. DEFINITION

Data Visualization (Data Viz) is the graphical representation of information and data. 
By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way 
to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

## 2. FOCUS

Built a specific project
A medical clinic requires the development of a data visualization.
Some questions are included, considering the date range from 2025-10-06 to 2025-10-11 (MVP â€“ proof of concept, in this case):
- What was the total revenue and revenue per unit?
- How many appointments are conducted per unit? And how many per medical specialty?
- Which medical specialty has the highest number of appointments per unit?

For this purpose, the Pandas library will be used to perform a series of pre-analysis steps before generating the requested dashboard.

To ensure effective project management and collaboration, the Trello platform will be used for organization and task tracking.

The dashboard will be built using Streamlit.
