# FUNCTIONS - CONCEPTS

## 1. DEFINITION

Block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly 
or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing 
the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls 
to reuse code contained in it over and over again

## 2. BENEFITS

- Increase Code Readability 
- Increase Code Reusability

## 3. TYPES

  ========================= ==========================================================
  Type                      Meaning
  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  Built-in library function Standard functions in Python that are available to use
  User-defined function     We can create our own functions based on our requirements
  Lambda functions          Small, anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword
  Recursive functions       A function that calls itself
